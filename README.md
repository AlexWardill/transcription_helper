# transcription_helper
Tool to help in manual interview transcription/script (dialogue) writing.

### Motivation
Friend asked me to help type up some recorded interviews for her documentary. I was imagining the process and thought about the waste of time of writing out the speaker each time...

### Instructions
- Add names of 2 speakers.
- Type up dialogue - the alternating names will be added to beginning of new line.
- Copy text to clipboard.

### Further Ideas
- Increase number of speakers
- Allow user to specify the number of new lines after which the next speaker's name appears.
- ...design a fully functioning audio to text transcription application which can identify different speakers from their voice and does it all for you...
